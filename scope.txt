Questions
What is scope? Your explanation should include the idea of global vs. local scope.
Scope defines how a variable may be accessed, or not accessed, at different points in the code.  There are two types of scope:
global scope and local scope.  A variable declared outside a function is considered global scope  and is able to be accessed
through-out your code.  A variable declared within a function is considered local scope and can only be accessed within the
function to where it resides.

Why are global variables avoided?
Global variables can cause uninteded side effects causing the code to be indeterminate which can yield different output given
the same imput.  Thereby creating code that can be difficult to debug.

Explain JavaScript's strict mode
Strict mode will not allow a variable be declared without using the syntax of "var" in naming a variable.  This would result in
an error.  This especially protects against any mutatiob of a global variable.

What are side effects, and what is a pure function?
Side efffects is when a function looks outside itself, or its local scope, to access a variable in a parent scope and alters
the value of that variable.   A pure function is a function that will always return the same value, give the same input.
This is called a determinate function.  Also, in order for a function to be pure, it must not have any side effects.

Explain variable hoisting in JavaScript.
Hoisting is a peculiarity that occurs when JavaScript reads variables when parsing and executing code.  It refers to the way
the JavaScript interpreter finds every variable definition within a given scope and moves it to the top of that scope.
